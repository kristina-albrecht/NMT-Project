# Neural Machine Translation Model using DVC Pipeline.

This repository is used for training purposes to experiment with a neural machine translation model using DVC pipeline.
The goal is to start small and being able to iterate fast through the entrire ML pipeline including 
- data preparation
- featurization
- model training and
- evaluation

and being able to keep track of different models and their performance.
